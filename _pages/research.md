## Research themes

### 1) Marine geophysics
**Overview:**  
I study how mechanical properties of the oceanic lithosphere shape fault segmentation and earthquake behavior, with a focus on oceanic transform faults. My work combines seismological observations with quantitative analysis and modern computational methods to link fault-zone structure to rupture processes. Ultimately, I aim to improve our understanding of how variations in material properties control where and how large earthquakes occur in oceanic plate-boundary settings.

### 2) AI and seismological methods
**Overview:**  
I develop and apply modern AI methods—particularly computer vision and machine learning—to detect, classify, and interpret seismic sources in challenging settings (e.g., dense aftershock sequences and complex fault systems). A key goal is rapid, reliable source detection that can scale to large datasets and provide actionable insight during earthquake sequences. This work bridges seismology with data-centric approaches to better resolve spatiotemporal patterns in seismicity and the underlying fault structure.

### 3) Environmental seismology
**Overview:**  
I am interested in how seismic observations can be used to study environmental processes, including cryosphere-related signals and other non-tectonic sources. This theme focuses on extracting weak and repeating signals from continuous seismic data, combining waveform similarity, detection pipelines, and machine learning to identify events and connect them to environmental drivers. The broader goal is to use seismology as a remote sensing tool for monitoring environmental change.
