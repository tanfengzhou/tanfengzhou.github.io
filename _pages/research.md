## Research themes

### 1) Marine geophysics
**Overview:**  
I study faulting and earthquake processes, with a focus on oceanic transform faults. 

<!-- Add 1–3 images later. Put files under /images/projects/transform-faults/ -->
<!-- Example:

<br>
<img src="/images/projects/transform-faults/result.png" alt="Key result figure" width="750">
-->

**Selected publications:**  
- **Tan, F.**, Fan, W., Shearer, P. M., Behn, M. D., & McGuire, J. J. (2025). *Variations in mechanical properties control segmentation of oceanic transform faults.* Under revision at **Nature Communications**.

### 2) AI and seismological methods
**Overview:**  
I develop modern seismological and AI-based methods to study seismic signals.

### 3) Environmental seismology
**Overview:**  
I am interested in how seismic observations can be used to study environmental processes, including cryosphere-related signals and other non-tectonic sources. This theme focuses on extracting weak environmental seismic signals from continuous data, combining detection, location and machine learning workflows to identify events and connect them to environmental drivers. The broader goal is to use seismology as a continuous tool for monitoring environmental phenamena.

**Selected publications:**  
- **Tan, F.**, Fan, W., & Shearer, P. (2026). *Searching for glacier-related seismic events in Greenland with waveform similarity and machine learning.* Submitted to **SSA** Annual Meeting.
