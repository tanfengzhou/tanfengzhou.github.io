## Research themes

### 1) Marine geophysics
**Overview:**  
I study faulting and earthquake processes, with a focus on oceanic transform faults.

**Selected publications:**  
- **Tan, F.**, Fan, W., Shearer, P. M., Behn, M. D., & McGuire, J. J. (2025). *Variations in mechanical properties control segmentation of oceanic transform faults.* Under revision at **Nature Communications**.

### 2) AI and seismological methods
**Overview:**  
I develop modern seismological and AI-based methods to study seismic signals. One of the key contributions is the Source Untangler Guided by Artificial intelligence image Recognition (SUGAR). SUGAR introduces a computer-vision framing of seismic source detection: it turns the detection/location into a 3-D image segmentation problem, rather than relying only on traditional pick-and-associate workflows. By integrating waveform stacking and 3-D computer vision, SUGAR is robust when events overlap strongly in space and time. In synthetic and real-data tests, the workflow is reported to characterize intense, complex sequences in near real time, outperforming both commonly used AI/non-AI approaches and skilled analyst workflows in these challenging scenarios.

### 3) Environmental seismology
**Overview:**  
I am interested in how seismic observations can be used to study environmental processes, including cryosphere-related signals and other non-tectonic sources. This theme focuses on extracting weak environmental seismic signals from continuous data, combining detection, location and machine learning workflows to identify events and connect them to environmental drivers. The broader goal is to use seismology as a continuous tool for monitoring environmental phenamena.
