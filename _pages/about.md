I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)**. My research focuses on **earthquakes**, **modern AI/ML methods**, and **environmental seismology**.

## Research themes
- **Marine geophysics** — seismicity, fault mechanics and segmentation on oceanic transform faults.  
- **AI and seismological methods** — computer-vision approaches for complex seismic sequences.  
- **Environmental seismology** — cryosphere and environment-related seismic observations.
