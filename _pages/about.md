I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)**. My research focuses on **earthquakes**, **modern AI/ML methods**, and **environmental seismology**.

## Research themes
- **[Marine geophysics](/research/#marine-geophysics)** — seismicity, fault mechanics and segmentation on oceanic transform faults.  
- **[AI and seismological methods](/research/#ai-and-seismological-methods)** — computer-vision approaches for complex seismic sequences.  
- **[Environmental seismology](/research/#environmental-seismology)** — cryosphere and environment-related seismic observations.
